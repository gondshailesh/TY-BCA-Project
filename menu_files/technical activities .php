          <strong>Robotic Expo:-</strong>
          Robotics is an interdisciplinary engineering science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
          These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance.
          This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. Various Robos developed by our Students were demonstrated.
