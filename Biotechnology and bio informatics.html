            Bioinformatics is the science concerned with the development and application of computer hardware and software to the acquisition, storage, analysis, visualization and application of biological information. Bioinformatics is the future technology, it is the merger of Biotechnology and Information technology the two leading technologies of the century. Genomics, Proteomics, Molecular Modeling, Structure Prediction, Structure Based Drug Designing; Data mining are some of the core areas of Bioinformatics.
